Have you ever noticed how the right kind of programming can fascinate your dog with television?

This may be due to a relaxing scenic image or a high-speed chase, but it is very hard not to notice when your dog is happy and noticing a moving image on the TV screen.

“Dogs can basically see television as we do,” says Dr. Bernadine Cruz of Laguna Hills Animal Hospital in California. 

Cruz explains that HD television, in particular, refreshes frames at a faster rate, which can smooth out the images and make television viewing more realistic for our dogs with such keen eyesight. 

Since the television can offer a ton of fast-moving intrigue during an otherwise humdrum day, it’s not surprising that your dog enjoys channel surfing as much as you do.

According to Dr. Cruz, there’s nothing wrong with turning the television on for your pet, as long as it’s within reason.
