Dear Friend,

Managing databases can't only be done with a relational management system (RDBMS), you know. 

Now, you can also take advantage of Non Relational Database or NoSQL to manage databases more flexible.

Not only that, many large companies like Amazon have switched to using it because it is more suitable for data development according to technological advances.

So, what is Non Relational Database or NoSQL and how does it work?

Well, In this letter, [I will](/) explain them maybe in depth.

So, Starting from the understanding, advantages, to the differences between Relational Database(SQL) and Non Relational Database(NoSQL). Are you curious? 

Let's Go.

## So, What is Non Relational Database or NoSQL?

NoSQL stands for Not Only SQL. 

This database management system is Non Relational. 

You know, This means that Non Relational Database can manage databases with a flexible schema and does not require complex queries like Relational Database.

With this approach, Non Relational Database has high scalability to be able to expand according to existing data needs. 

Not surprisingly, database management is considered the most suitable for processing even the ever-changing big data.

Now, Various large companies such as Facebook and Google also take advantage of Non Relational Database in their business. 

The reason is, Non Relational Database has the ability to support real-time web applications.

How can this database management be so useful? 

This is because, it's supported by a choice of various types of databases that can be used as needed.

## Types of Non Relational Databases

In general, the Non Relational Database or NoSQL database can be divided into four types, namely:

### 1. Key-value

This type of database stores the database in key / value pairs in the form of a simple hash table. 

So, it's suitable for those of you who want to store a lot of data without using complicated queries when you want to process it.

In key-value, each key is unique, while the value can be JSON, BLOB (Binary Large Objects), strings, and so on. For example, you can see it below:

    </a>
</p>

Some of the popular key-value databases are Redis, DynamoDB, and Riak.

### 2. Column-based

Column-based (also known as wide-column) is a type of Non Relational Database that stores data in columns. 

So, column-based is perfect queries for SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, etc.

You can see an example of a column-based NoSQL below:

<p align="center">

        <img src="https://niagaspace.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11092754/contoh-database-column-based-nosql.png" title="Non Relational Database NoSQL Column-based" alt="Non Relational Database NoSQL Column-based" width="500" />
    </a>
</p>


The main advantage of column-based Non Relational Database is the flexibility of its columns. 

Each column is not tied to any other column. 

So, you are free to change any column without affecting the others.

Some popular column-based databases are HBase, Cassandra, and Hypertable.

### 3. Document-oriented

This type of database uses data that contains a pair of keys and values ​​that are stored in a document in JSON or XML format. 

The values ​​here can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

For clarity, here is a comparison of Relational Database(SQL) and Document-Oriented Non Relational Database(NoSQL):

<p align="center">

        <img src="https://lennilobel.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/i2.png" title="Non Relational Database NoSQL Document-oriented" alt="Non Relational Database NoSQL Document-oriented"  />
    </a>
</p>

For those of you who are familiar with JSON, you will certainly see the similarities in the structure used by this Non Relational Database type.

This structure is different from SQL-style relational tables which have rows and columns.

With this approach, you don't need to know the columns in advance like in SQL. 

Very flexible, right? 

Not surprisingly, this type of document-oriented database is mostly used for CMS, blogging platforms, real-time analytics, and e-commerce applications.

Some of the popular document-oriented databases are Amazon SimpleDB, CouchDB, and MongoDB.

### 4. Graph-based

Graph-based is a type of Non Relational Database that focuses on storing relationships between entities. 

These entities are stored in the form of nodes, while the relationships between the entities are known as edges.

Here's an example of a graph-based NoSQL:

<p align="center">
    <a href="/" >
        <img src="https://niagaspace.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11093216/contoh-database-graph-based-nosql.png" title="Non Relational Database NoSQL Graph-based" alt="Non Relational Database NoSQL Graph-based" width="500" />
    </a>
</p>

Graph-based is perfect if you want to find patterns that relate to each other in data. 

Therefore, this type of database is generally used for social media, fraud detection, and spatial data.

Some of the most popular graph-based databases are Neo4J, JanusGraph, and InfiniteGraph.

## Non Relational Database advantages

Here are some of the advantages of Non Relational Database over Relational Databases:

### 1. Easier and Cheaper Scalability

Non Relational Database makes it easy to "scale out." This scalability method allows you to add cloud servers and connect to database clusters with ease.

    </a>
</p>


So, you don't have to buy new, more expensive, hardware to handle data spikes. 

Pretty pocket friendly, right?

### 2. Stores Lots of Data without Sacrificing Performance

Did you know that Non Relational Database can store a lot of data at once without sacrificing performance? 

This happens because it's easy to "scale out" at any time according to previous explanation.

So, when there is a data spike, you can freely add servers to accommodate the load evenly. 

This is one of the reasons many large companies use it.

### 3. High Flexibility that Supports Several Types of Databases

Non Relational Database is a very flexible database management. 

Not only supports four types of databases, Non Relational Database is also capable of storing unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data.

This means that you have more flexibility in managing the database, both according to your needs and according to the data you have.

Say, your data is still varied and growing, so you don't have to bother designing table schemas at the beginning like Relational Database(SQL).

### 4. More Developer Friendly

Managing a database is indeed a compulsory skill for developers. 

Even though the job is not easy, with the help of Non Relational Database the process can be simpler. Why? 

Here are a few reasons:

* You don't need to write SQL queries that get more and more complex as the data grows.

* Data in Non Relational Database can be in the form of JSON or XML which is certainly more familiar to developers.

* You can display data quickly without having to create schema over and over again.

* There are many Non Relational Database that are open-source and free. So, you can save money if you want to try it first.

## Relational database vs Non Relational Database

Here are the differences between Relational Database(SQL) and Non Relational Database(NoSQL) that you should consider before using them:

</p>

## Conclusion

Although at first glance similar, Non Relational Database(NoSQL) is different from Relational Database(SQL) in terms of data management. 

NoSQL is a Non Relational Database Management that has four types. 

Starting from Key-Value, Column-Based, Document-Oriented and Graph-Based.

This approach gives Non Relational Database its advantages, for example .

* Easier to scale out without having to buy expensive servers.

* Able to store a lot of data with good performance.

* Flexible for various needs and data.

* More developer-friendly in its development.
